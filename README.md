## Overview
- This is a toy project written in Rust which implements a simple version of the good old snake game
- It runs on the console window with string input
## Purpose
- Get used to the Rust language by integrating multiple features such as:
  - organizing code into submodules
  - mpsc channels for interthread communication
  - multithreading
  - pattern matching
  - iterator based flow (with monadic flavor)
  - using external create (ex. rand)
## How to run the program
- ```cargo run``` to start the game
- Press 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' and enter to switch direction
